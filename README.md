# README #

This README would document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Git clone the Repo
* Set up DB "geek_combat" on your local MySQL. (In case you do not have mysql , please install)
* Install the project as "Maven Project" and run "mvn clean install" to download all the necessary dependencies.
* Inside "src/main/resources" , please update your local mysql password. Do not commit this file onto the master branch since it would override other's password.
* In order to run the application , open file "src/main/java/com/ttn/TTNApplication.java" and run the main method using "Java Application option" .
